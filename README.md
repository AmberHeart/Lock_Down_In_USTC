## LOCK-DOWN IN USTC ——程设进阶大作业

这个仓库是大一下学期课程“程序设计与进阶”的课设大作业，基于python的pygame模块实现的一个类60s小游戏，游戏背景是极具时代特色的疫情封校背景下通过不断规划和获取物资以维持生存进而达成不同的结局

This repository is a major project for the course 'Advanced Programming and Design' in the second semester of the freshman year. It is a Python-based pygame module implementation of a 60-second mini-game set in a highly topical context of pandemic-induced school closures, where survival is achieved through continuous planning and resource acquisition, leading to various outcomes.
